A quick prototype for the HTML Energy [HTML Day Freewrite](https://html.energy/events.html) in 2023. The app uses various OCR methods to parse and deploy HTML from an image to a cloud server.

An initial prototype used local OCR, a second iteration added more reliable handwriting parsing with the Google Vision API, and in 2024 a third iteration added LLM powered OCR using both the ChatGPT API and the Anthropic Claude API.

The most successful webpage is (so far!): [irlhtml.glitch.me/pages/1c2e169b-b929-47e5-8fb4-266ff703abe6](https://irlhtml.glitch.me/pages/1c2e169b-b929-47e5-8fb4-266ff703abe6)
