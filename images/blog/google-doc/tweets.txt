I felt dumb because I couldn't figure out how to download an image from a google doc, but the after googling the answer you're supposed to export it as a zipped web page to get it.

it would be really nice if one could download an image from a google doc instead of having to save it locally and then extract.

Hey @googledocs, what's thinking behind making it so hard to download an image, out of a Google Doc?  I mean, sure I can work around the obtuseness.  But why isn't "download image" one of the options in the right-click menu?

Google docs still has no way of letting you download or expand an embedded image.

Things that are not easy #4721 - downloading images from Google Docs. 

The only way: File > Download As...> html, zipped> Unzip, get image.

Right-click, inspect element, and grab the url from the href

This only works if you are not selecting the image in the Google doc
