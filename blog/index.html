            Last year before HTML Energy&#x27;s HTML Day in San Francisco I had the idea to
    iterate on some of my previous projects like Whiteboard Email, and make both an
    app that would do OCR on HTML, and a website to host truly “hand-written” HTML.
    That became IRL HTML and it was good enough to make some very simple websites!

            Earlier this year I wanted to explore the new async/await functionality in
    Javascript so I started playing around with a project on Glitch (glitch.com)
    that would call one API after another, then generate new API call options from
    each cycle. I compiled a long list of potential APIs to use, but didn’t get past
    chaining together an API that will re…

            This fall Mouse launched our brand new Sewable Tech Course! The course
    introduces learners to circuitry and electronics without the abstraction of a
    breadboard. In the final two projects in the course we use a wearable Arduino to
    prototype a DIY activity tracker.
